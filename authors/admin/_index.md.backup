I’m a third year PhD student at the [Bio-Inspired Robotics Laboratory](https://birlab.org/), under the supervision of Professor Fumiya Iida. I work on the implementation of unconventional soft materials in robotic systems, with a particular interest in medical applications. I'm also part of the [SHERO project](http://www.sherofet.eu/) for self-healing soft robotics.

In my spare time I enjoy playing badminton and tennis, and I’m a member of the world-famous [Magic Circle](https://themagiccircle.co.uk/).
