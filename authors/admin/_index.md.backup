I'm a [Junior Research Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Research_Fellowships) (JRF) at [Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge](https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/). Most of my days are spent building tactile sensors and artificial skins in Cambridge's [Bio-Inspired Robotics Laboratory](https://birlab.org/), where I hold an [EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellowship](https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/developing-people-and-skills/epsrc/studentships/flexibility-for-funders/epsrc-doctoral-prize/).

During my PhD I also worked as a visiting researcher in EPFL's [CREATE Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/create/), and in [TTP](https://www.ttp.com/industries/healthcare/)'s surgical team. 

In my spare time I enjoy playing badminton and tennis, and Iâ€™m a member of the world-famous [Magic Circle](https://themagiccircle.co.uk/).

I was part of the Horizon 2020 SHERO Project for self-healing robotics, and the Samsung Global Research Outreach project on tactile perception.
