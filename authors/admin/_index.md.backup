I’m in my final year of a PhD at Cambridge's [Bio-Inspired Robotics Laboratory](https://birlab.org/), building tactile sensors and artificial skins. I was part of the Horizon 2020 [SHERO project](http://www.sherofet.eu/) for self-healing robotics, and the Samsung Global Research Outreach project on tactile perception. Over the Summer of 2024, I am a visiting researcher at EPFL's [CREATE Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/create/). 

In my spare time I enjoy playing badminton and tennis, and I’m a member of the world-famous [Magic Circle](https://themagiccircle.co.uk/).
