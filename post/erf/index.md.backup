summary: I presented my thesis at ERF 2025 as one of the finalists of the best European thesis in robotics prize.

title: euRobotics Georges Giralt PhD Award

It’s been an eventful few days in Stuttgart: yesterday I took to the stage at the 2025 European Robotics Forum to present my work as one of four finalists in the Georges Giralt prize for the best European PhD thesis in robotics.

It certainly feels strange to have made it to this point: when I first joined Cambridge's Bio-Inspired Robotics Lab (BIRL) as an undergraduate with minimal knowledge of anything robot-shaped, I would have really struggled to believe that I’d soon be competing in an award for “extraordinary contributions in robotics” just a few years down the line.

Besides the formality of the presentations & awards, it’s been a joy to meet and share some drinks with Ignacio, Michele, & Erfan (the very rightful winner) – I can’t wait to see the things that they all go on to achieve!
