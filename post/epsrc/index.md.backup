Based on my PhD work on sensorised skins for soft robots, I've been awarded a 2024-2025 Doctoral Prize Fellowship from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([EPSRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/)). According to their website:

_"The EPSRC Doctoral Prize helps universities retain and recruit the best doctoral students receiving EPSRC support to increase the impact of their doctorate, and to improve retention of the very best students in research careers."_

Alongside my JRF, this position gives me a brilliant amount of freedom to pursue my personal research, pushing these technologies and their impact as far as possible.
