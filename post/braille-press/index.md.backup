title: Braille-reading robot features on Cambridge University's website

Our new paper "High-Speed Tactile Braille Reading via Biomimetic Sliding Interactions" is featured on Cambridge University's research news following its publication in *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters*.

This work looks at the ways we can use vision-based tactile sensors to interact continuously with the world around us. Braille is an excellent testing ground: whilst it is possible to read each letter one-by-one, it's much quicker to use a continuous sliding motion like humans do!
