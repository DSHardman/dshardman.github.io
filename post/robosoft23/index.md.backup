title: Talks at RoboSoft
---

During the packed and exciting schedule of the 6th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft 2023), I was invited to give 2 talks and present one poster (even featuring on the conference's twitter feed!). Details of all can be found below.

* **"Learning-Based Sensing for Soft Applications."** An invited 20-minute talk in the _Modelling Challenges for Soft Robots_ workshop.

* **"Composite Stretchable Sensors for the Detection of Asymmetric Deformations in a Soft Manipulator."** A 15-minute talk accompanying a paper of the same name being published in the conference proceedings.

* **"Material-level Sensorization of Hydrogel-based Skins using Data-Driven EIT."** A poster within the _Embodied Intelligence and Soft Robotics_ workshop, alongside a flash talk of its content.

* **"Variable Response Characteristics of a Soft Sensorized Hydrogel using
Mesoscale Cellular Structures."** A poster of a paper which I co-authored in the conference proceedings, presented by first author Naoki Tano.
