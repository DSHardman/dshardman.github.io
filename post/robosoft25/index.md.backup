Last week, I returned to Lausanne for the wonderfully-organised [RoboSoft 2025](https://robosoft2025.org/) conference. Among watching some great presentations + meeting friends old and new at EPFL, I spent the week sharing some of the details of our upcoming work on [multimodal information structuring in a 3D hand](https://www.dshardman.co.uk/publication/scirohand/). This included workshop presentations on Wednesday 23rd, and the chairing of a breakout session on Sunday 25th's [Embodied Intelligence event](https://embodied-intelligence.org/25-years-of-embodied-intelligence-2025/). I even won the _"Advanced Robotics Research Special Prize"_ for my poster at the [Functional Materials workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/robosoftactuationandsensing/home).

In addition, our exciting new work **"Design and Modelling of Electrical Impedance Tomography-based 3D-Printed Patterned Soft Tactile Skins"** was presented by first author Yunqi Huang (UCL), and by the team at [EMPA](https://www.empa.ch/web/s201/smart-ceramic-processing).

I love seeing this event get bigger and bigger each year, and realising that I can recognise more and more of the community every time we meet. I'm already looking forward to 2026!
