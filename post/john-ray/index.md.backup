title: Upcoming Research Talk

From 6-7pm on Tuesday 28th February I'll be presenting the Bio-Inspired Robotics Lab's current research at the [John Ray Society](https://www.johnray.caths.cam.ac.uk/) of St Catherine's College Cambridge. Talk details can be found below.

**Aiming for All-Purpose Robotics**

_Though we have seen many robots and machines optimised to perform a specific task or solve a specific problem, the design of multipurpose robots continues to challenge us. In this talk, David Hardman (Cambridge Bio-Inspired Robotics Lab) introduces the key problems, illustrated with practical examples from his work on biomimetic e-skins._
