 abstract = {The ability to 3D print soft materials with integrated strain sensors enables significant flexibility for the design and fabrication of soft robots. Hydrogels provide an interesting alternative to traditional soft robot materials, allowing for more varied fabrication techniques. In this work, we investigate the 3D printing of a gelatin-glycerol hydrogel, where transglutaminase is used to catalyse the crosslinking of the hydrogel such that its material properties can be controlled for 3D printing. By including electron-conductive elements (aqueous carbon black) in the hydrogel we can create highly flexible and linear soft strain sensors. We present a first investigation into adapting a desktop 3D printer and optimizing its control parameters to fabricate sensorized 2D and 3D structures which can undergo >300% strain and show a response to strain which is highly linear and synchronous. To demonstrate the capabilities of this material and fabrication approach, we produce some example 2D and 3D structures and show their sensing capabilities.},
