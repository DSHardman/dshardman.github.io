abstract: As soft robotic systems become increasingly complex, there is a need to develop sensory systems which can provide rich state information to the robot for feedback control. Multi-axis force sensing and control is one of the less explored problems in this domain. There are numerous challenges in the development of a multi-axis soft sensor - from the design and fabrication to the data processing and modelling. This work presents the design and development of a novel multi-axis soft sensor using a gelatin-based ionic hydrogel and 3D printing technology. A learning-based modelling approach coupled with sensor redundancy is developed to model the environmentally dependent soft sensors. Numerous real-time experiments are conducted to test the performance of the sensor and its applicability in closed-loop control tasks. Our results indicate that the soft sensor can predict force values and orientation angle within 4% and 7% of their total range, respectively.
